          Hey there! I'm Annie, a software engineer with an eye for visual
          design and a track record of leading product initiatives from concept
          to launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey has been full of unexpected twists, both in life and
          career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally from Taiwan, I moved to NYC in 2017, chasing a chance to
          revamp digital media products. Along the way, I discovered my love for
          coding, which sparked a full pivot into software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond tech, Iâ€™m an adventurer at heart. In 2016, I took a trip to
          Europe with someone I barely knew. We fell in love. That sparked a
          43-day road trip across the Southern U.S. in 2017, a wedding in 2019,
          and navigating newlywed life during the global pandemic.
        </p>

        <p>Fast forward to 2023, I became a U.S. citizen.</p>
        <p>
          Looking back, the timing of it all feels surreal, and I am incredibly
          grateful for how everything aligned.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days, you can find me exploring NYC's food scene, taking
          spontaneous adventures, and discovering hidden gems in the city. I'm
          savoring every step of this incredible journey, both personally and
          professionally.

          Hey there! I'm Annie, and welcome to my little corner of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer with an eye for visual design and a track
          record of leading product initiatives from start to launch. Like any
          good story, mine has a few plot twists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally from Taiwan, I moved to New York City in 2017 for an
          opportunity to lead digital media products. During that time, I
          dabbled in coding, which sparked my interest in the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          The turbulent year of 2020 became a turning point for me, as I made
          the leap into software engineering. Now, I get to blend my product
          mindset with hands-on coding â€” the best of both worlds!
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond tech, I've always had a heart for adventure. In 2016, I set off
          on a trip to Europe with someone I barely knew, and (un)surprisingly,
          we fell in love. This twist led us to embark on an unforgettable
          43-day road trip across the Southern USA in early 2017.

        <p>
          These days, you can find me exploring NYC's food scene with that same
          travel buddy. From spontaneous adventures to discovering hidden gems
          in the city, I'm savoring every step of this incredible journey.
